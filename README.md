# Car Scene
#### Tate Osborne ~ November 19, 2021

Have fun playing with a car driving along a road!
This project displays a scene of a car driving. There are a few different commands that you can do to change the scene.

### Controls:
_(Note that the initial states of the car is moving east (right) in the top lane.)_
- `up` (arrow): Moves the car to the top lane.
- `down` (arrow): Moves the car to the bottom lane.
- `left` (arrow): Changes the car's direction to the west (left).
- `right` (arrow): Changes the car's direction to the east (right).

The only way to exit the screen is to press the `esc` button on your keyboard.
