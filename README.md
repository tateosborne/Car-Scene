# Car Scene (Module 4, OEP)
#### Tate Osborne ~ November 19, 2021

Have fun watching a car drive along a road!
This project displays a scene that looks like a car driving on a road. There are a few different commands that you,
as the user, can do to change the scene.

### Controls:
_(Note that the initial states of the car is moving east (right) in the top lane.)_
- `up` (arrow): Moves the car to the top lane.
- `down` (arrow): Moves the car to the bottom lane.
- `left` (arrow): Changes the car's direction to the west (left).
- `right` (arrow): Changes the car's direction to the east (right).

The only way to exit the screen is to press the `esc` button on your keyboard.

```
Personally, I believe that I deserve the full 50 points on this project. I demonstrate my understanding of locating
different objects, calling modifiers on these objects, showing objects that move (i.e. once off the screen, it wraps
around to pass through again), and the project is robust. Lastly, (I think) that the project looks pretty cool too.
